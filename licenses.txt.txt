LGPL: LPGL gives most of the same guarentees as GPL but prevents the user from utilizing libraries not licensed with LGPL.LGPL because it allowsthe redistribution
and incorporation without the requirement that a user release their source code. The LGPL does not give the same degree of freedom as GPL, only 
allowing users of the software to modify components licensed under the LGPL. GPL would allow linking to non GPL 
as well as being distributed under any terms. 
MIT:Allows users to distribute, use, publish and modify the source as they would please as long as they provide the copyright and same permission notice as is listed 
in the document they recieve. MIT also covers the liability. 
BSD:Allows for redistribution in source and binary forms. The name of the developer may not be used for marketing without written consent of the developer/organization.
All redistributions of the source must include the copy rights and attribution to the organization that created it. BSD prevents the use of
the organization name for advertisement and requires continuation of the copy right and attribution to the creator. 

I chose the MIT License because it guarentees attribution and that users continue to allow it to be free to use for anyone as long as they include the copyright. It
also allows the document to be passed onto others with the same compyright notice. The MIT license also covered liability. I did not significantly care about the
guarentees of my name not being used for advertisement in BSD or about the library linkage requirements in LGPL.
